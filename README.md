# pomodoro
This is a pomodoro timer created for a Python class I took.
The basic purpose is to give you incremented periods of working and taking breaks.
You work for 25 min before having a 5 min break.
After repeating several times, you are rewarded with a 30 min break.
In case you need to restart, there is a 'Reset' button that starts your timer from the top.
